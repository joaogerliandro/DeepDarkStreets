# DeepDarkStreets

This is a personal and academic project. Made in C++ and OpenGL with the purpose of improving my skills and techniques in the development of 3D games and applications, as well as promoting some fun and self-realization


This project initially consists of a 3D psychological horror game in first person. The major objective is to use shading and lighting techniques to generate a gloomy atmosphere around the game and provoke psychological terror in the player through the scenario and audio and video effects.
